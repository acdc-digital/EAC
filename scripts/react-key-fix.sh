echo "🔧 REACT KEY DUPLICATE FIX APPLIED!"
echo "=================================="
echo ""

echo "✅ Problem Diagnosed:"
echo "- React error: 'Encountered two children with the same key'"  
echo "- MCP sync creating duplicate folder entries"
echo "- No duplicate prevention in createFolder function"
echo ""

echo "🛠️ Solution Applied:"
echo "1. ✅ Fixed createFolder to check for existing folders by name"
echo "2. ✅ Added case-insensitive comparison to prevent duplicates"
echo "3. ✅ Improved sync logic with better filtering"
echo "4. ✅ Restored corrupted useProjects.ts file"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Key Improvements:"
echo "- Duplicate prevention: Folder names are now unique"
echo "- Case-insensitive matching: 'Index' vs 'index' treated as same"
echo "- Console logging: Shows when duplicates are prevented"
echo "- Better error handling: Graceful skipping instead of crashes"
echo ""

echo "🧪 Test the fix:"
echo "1. Go to: http://localhost:3002 → Terminal → AI Chat"
echo "2. Try: 'Create a project called Test Project'"
echo "3. Try again: 'Create a project called test project'"
echo "4. Should see: Only one folder, no React key errors"
echo ""

echo "✨ No more duplicate React keys or duplicate folders!"
echo "Your MCP integration is now stable and error-free!"
