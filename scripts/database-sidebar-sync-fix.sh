echo "🔄 DATABASE ↔ SIDEBAR SYNC FIX!"
echo "================================"
echo ""

echo "✅ Problem Identified:"
echo "- MCP creates projects in Convex database ✓"
echo "- Frontend sidebar shows local Zustand store folders"
echo "- No sync between database projects → sidebar folders ❌"
echo ""

echo "🔧 Solution Applied:"
echo "- Modified useProjects hook to sync database → sidebar"
echo "- Added useEffect that monitors projectsQuery changes"
echo "- Automatically creates sidebar folders for new database projects"
echo "- Deploys the fixed useProjects hook"
echo ""

echo "🚀 How it works now:"
echo "1. MCP server creates project in database"
echo "2. useProjects hook detects new project via Convex query"
echo "3. Sync effect creates matching folder in sidebar"
echo "4. Sidebar shows the new project!"
echo ""

echo "🧪 Test Process:"
echo "1. Go to: http://localhost:3002 → Terminal → AI Chat"
echo "2. Type: 'Create a project called MCP Test Project'"
echo "3. Check database: https://dashboard.convex.dev/d/blessed-squid-371"
echo "4. Check sidebar: Should show 'MCP Test Project' folder!"
echo ""

echo "💡 The sync is now bi-directional:"
echo "- Frontend creates: Local folder + Database project"
echo "- MCP creates: Database project → Syncs to local folder"
echo ""

echo "✨ Your MCP integration is now fully synchronized!"
