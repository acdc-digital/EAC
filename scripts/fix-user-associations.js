console.log('🔧 Fixing user associations in the database...');

// This script would need to be run against the Convex database to:
// 1. Find all records with "temp-user-id" 
// 2. Update them with proper user IDs
// 3. Ensure all social connections are properly linked

📝 Manual Database Fixes Needed:

1. **agentPosts table:**
   - Find all records with userId = "temp-user-id" 
   - Update them with the correct user ID based on creation patterns

2. **socialConnections table:**
   - Ensure all connections have proper userId links
   - Remove any orphaned connections

3. **chat sessions:**
   - Verify sessionId persistence across sign-in/out

4. **Project associations:**
   - Verify all projects are properly linked to users
   - Ensure Instructions and Content Creation projects exist for all users

🚀 Code changes made:
✅ Fixed authentication in chat queries (getChatMessages, getUserSessions)
✅ Fixed authentication in files queries (getDeletedFiles, getInstructionFiles)  
✅ Fixed authentication in projects queries (generateProjectNumber)
✅ Added Content Creation project system (ensureContentCreationProject)
✅ Fixed socialPosts to use authenticated user instead of temp-user-id
✅ Fixed chat message storage to handle unauthenticated gracefully
✅ Added useContentCreation hook to match useInstructions pattern

🎯 Expected Results:
- Sign-out no longer throws authentication errors
- User projects and files persist between sessions
- Chat sessions are maintained with proper user links
- Both Instructions and Content Creation folders appear on sign-in
- All new content is properly linked to authenticated users
