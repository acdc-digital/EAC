echo "- Improved project name extraction with better regex patterns"
echo "- Added proper null checks for TypeScript"

echo "🚀 Ready to Test:"
echo ""
echo "1. Go to: http://localhost:3002"
echo "2. Click Terminal tab → AI Chat"
echo "3. Type: 'can you create a project for me called index'"
echo ""

echo "📝 Expected Result:"
echo ""
echo "  $ user: can you create a project for me called index"
echo "  $ system: Project Created Successfully!"
echo "  ✅ **index**"
echo "     📅 Created: [today's date]"
echo "     📊 Status: active"
echo "     🔢 Project ID: [generated ID]"
echo ""
echo "  Project \"index\" has been created in your database!"

echo "🔍 Verification:"
