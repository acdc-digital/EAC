echo "✅ React Layout & Key Duplicate Issues Fixed!"
echo "============================================"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Issues Resolved:"
echo "1. ❌ Resizable Panel Layout: 70% + 40% = 110% (invalid)"
echo "2. ❌ React Key Duplicates: Multiple folders with same timestamp ID"
echo ""

echo "🔧 Fixes Applied:"
echo ""

echo "1. ✅ Fixed Resizable Panel Layout:"
echo "   - dashEditor.tsx: defaultSize 70% → 60%"
echo "   - terminal.tsx: defaultSize 40% → 30%"
echo "   - Total layout: 60% + 30% = 90% (valid, allows for auto-resize)"
echo ""

echo "2. ✅ Fixed React Key Duplicates:"
echo "   - Enhanced ID generation with random suffix to prevent collisions"
echo "   - Added sequential processing with 10ms delays during sync"
echo "   - Improved duplicate checking by name (case-insensitive)"
echo ""

echo "🚀 Changes Made:"
echo ""

echo "File: dashEditor.tsx"
echo "  - Line 209: defaultSize={60} (was 70)"
echo ""

echo "File: terminal.tsx"
echo "  - Line 31: defaultSize={isCollapsed ? 2.75 : 30} (was 40)"
echo ""

echo "File: store/editor/index.ts"
echo "  - Enhanced createFolder ID generation:"
echo "    const randomSuffix = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 8);"
echo "    const id = \`folder-\${name}-\${Date.now()}-\${randomSuffix}\`;"
echo ""

echo "File: lib/hooks/useProjects.ts"
echo "  - Added sequential processing with setTimeout delays"
echo "  - Prevents rapid-fire folder creation during database sync"
echo ""

echo "🧪 Test Results Expected:"
echo "- ✅ No more 'Invalid layout total size' warnings"
echo "- ✅ No more 'Encountered two children with the same key' errors"
echo "- ✅ Proper panel sizing (60% editor + 30% terminal = 90% total)"
echo "- ✅ Unique folder IDs even during rapid sync operations"
echo ""

echo "🔍 How to Verify:"
echo "1. Refresh your browser (localhost:3002)"
echo "2. Check browser console - should be clean"
echo "3. Try creating multiple projects via MCP chat"
echo "4. Resize panels - should work smoothly"
echo "5. No duplicate React key warnings should appear"
echo ""

echo "💡 The fixes ensure stable layout and proper React reconciliation!"
