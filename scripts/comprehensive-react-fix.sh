echo "1. ‚úÖ React Key Duplicates:"
echo "   - Enhanced createFolder with crypto.randomUUID() when available"
echo "   - Added double-check uniqueness against all existing folder IDs"
echo "   - Improved case-insensitive name comparison"
echo "   - Added failsafe loop to ensure truly unique IDs"
echo ""

echo "2. ‚úÖ Resizable Panel Layout:"
echo "   - Added proper panel IDs: 'editor-main' and 'terminal'"
echo "   - Fixed layout sizing: 60% editor + 40% terminal = 100%"
echo "   - Removed invalid layout warnings"
echo ""

echo "3. ‚úÖ Storage Reset Script Created:"
echo "   - Created reset-storage.js for clearing persisted bad data"
echo "   - Clears localStorage, sessionStorage, and IndexedDB"

echo "üîç Technical Details:"
echo ""
echo "ID Generation Strategy:"
echo "  - Primary: crypto.randomUUID() (most secure)"
echo "  - Fallback: timestamp + random + counter"
echo "  - Safety: Loop to ensure uniqueness"
echo ""

echo "Panel Layout:"
echo "  - Editor: 60% (min 30%, id='editor-main')"
echo "  - Terminal: 40% (min 15%, max 60%, id='terminal')"
echo "  - Total: 100% (valid layout)"
echo ""

echo "Storage Reset Targets:"
echo "  - localStorage keys: eac-*, editor-*, project-*, zustand*"
echo "  - sessionStorage: all data"
echo "  - IndexedDB: all databases"
