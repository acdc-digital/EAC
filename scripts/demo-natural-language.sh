echo "🚀 To enable this in your EAC project:"
echo ""
echo "1. Deploy the enhanced Convex functions:"
echo "   cd convex && npx convex deploy"
echo ""
echo "2. Start the development server:"  
echo "   pnpm dev"
echo ""
echo "3. Open the terminal chat tab and try:"
echo "   - 'Analyze the project structure'"
echo "   - 'What components do we have?'"
echo "   - 'Show me the Zustand stores'"
echo "   - 'Generate a metrics dashboard component'"
echo ""
echo "The AI will automatically detect when to use MCP analysis"
echo "and provide detailed, accurate responses about your project!"
