## Cost Structure Analysis

### Per-Token Economics

```
Input Token Cost:  $0.000003 per token
Output Token Cost: $0.000015 per token
Ratio:             Output tokens cost 5x more than input tokens
```

### Session-Level Economics

#### Default Session (180K tokens)
- **Maximum Input Cost**: $540 (if all input tokens)
- **Maximum Output Cost**: $2,700 (if all output tokens)
- **Typical Mixed Session**: ~$800-1,200 (estimated 60% input, 40% output)

#### Conversation Examples

**Light Usage (10K tokens)**
- Input: 7,000 tokens × $0.000003 = $0.021
- Output: 3,000 tokens × $0.000015 = $0.045
- **Total**: $0.066 per conversation

**Medium Usage (50K tokens)**
- Input: 35,000 tokens × $0.000003 = $0.105
- Output: 15,000 tokens × $0.000015 = $0.225
- **Total**: $0.33 per conversation

**Heavy Usage (150K tokens)**
- Input: 100,000 tokens × $0.000003 = $0.30
- Output: 50,000 tokens × $0.000015 = $0.75
- **Total**: $1.05 per conversation

### Daily Usage Scenarios

**Individual Developer (10 sessions/day)**
- Average session: 30K tokens
- Daily cost: ~$2.70
- Monthly cost: ~$81
- Annual cost: ~$985

**Small Team (5 users, 50 sessions/day)**
- Daily cost: ~$13.50
- Monthly cost: ~$405
- Annual cost: ~$4,925

**Enterprise Team (25 users, 250 sessions/day)**
- Daily cost: ~$67.50
- Monthly cost: ~$2,025
- Annual cost: ~$24,625

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Model Selection Optimization

**Alternative Models for Cost Reduction:**

| Model | Input Cost | Output Cost | Use Case | Savings |
|-------|------------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Claude Haiku 3.5 | $0.80/MTok | $4/MTok | Simple queries | 73% reduction |
| Claude Haiku 3 | $0.25/MTok | $1.25/MTok | Basic interactions | 92% reduction |

**Recommendation**: Implement intelligent model routing:
- Haiku 3.5 for simple Q&A (< 5K tokens)
- Sonnet 3.7 for complex reasoning (5K-50K tokens)
- Potential savings: 40-60% on total costs

### 2. Session Management Optimization

**Current Implementation Benefits:**
- Token tracking prevents cost overruns
- 180K token limit provides safety margin
- Session recycling reduces initialization overhead

**Additional Optimizations:**
- Implement conversation summarization at 75% capacity
- Archive old sessions to reduce active context
- Smart context trimming for long conversations

### 3. Batch Processing Implementation

**Batch API Benefits:**
- 50% discount on both input and output tokens
- Claude Sonnet 3.7 Batch: $1.50 input, $7.50 output
- Suitable for non-real-time processing

**Potential Applications:**
- Report generation
- Bulk code analysis
- Content processing
- Research summaries

### 4. Prompt Caching Strategy

**Cache Pricing (Claude Sonnet 3.7):**
- 5-minute cache writes: $3.75/MTok
- 1-hour cache writes: $6.00/MTok
- Cache hits: $0.30/MTok (90% savings)

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Cache system prompts and instructions
- Cache project context and documentation
- Cache frequently used code snippets

## Risk Assessment & Monitoring

### Cost Control Mechanisms

**Currently Implemented:**
