## Architecture

### Agent Definition

The Twitter Post Agent is defined in the agent store with the following structure:

```typescript
{
  id: 'twitter-post',
  name: 'Twitter Post',
  description: 'Create, schedule, and post Twitter/X content with full workflow automation',
  isActive: false,
  icon: 'Bot',
  tools: [
    {
      id: 'create-twitter-post',
      name: 'Create Twitter Post',
      command: '/twitter',
      description: 'Create and manage a complete Twitter post workflow',
      parameters: [
        {
          name: 'content',
          type: 'string',
          description: 'The content for your Twitter post',
          required: true
        },
        {
          name: 'project',
          type: 'string',
          description: 'Which project to add the post to (optional)',
          required: false
        },
        {
          name: 'schedule',
          type: 'string',
          description: 'Schedule date/time (e.g., "tomorrow 2pm", "Dec 25 9am")',
          required: false
        },
        {
          name: 'settings',
          type: 'select',
          description: 'Post settings and reply settings',
          required: false,
          options: ['everyone', 'followers', 'mentioned-users', 'verified-accounts']
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Workflow Implementation

The Twitter Post Agent implements the exact workflow you requested:

#### Step 1: File Creation

- Creates new file with `.x` extension
- Asks user which project to add it to
- Uses intelligent project selection logic

#### Step 2: Form Field Completion

- Fills in the Twitter post content
- Sets appropriate character limits (280 characters)
- Prepares form data structure

#### Step 3: Default Settings Application

- Sets reply settings (everyone, followers, mentioned users, verified)
- Configures thread settings (single tweet by default)
- Sets up poll options (disabled by default)

#### Step 4: Scheduling Operations

- Parses natural language scheduling requests
- Converts to appropriate date/time format
- Integrates with existing scheduling system

#### Step 5: Posting/Scheduling

- Either posts immediately or schedules for later
- Updates file status appropriately
- Provides user feedback on action taken

## Usage Examples

### Basic Post Creation

```bash
/twitter Check out our new dashboard features! Really excited to share this with the community.

```

**Result:**

- Creates scheduled post file
- Sets up automatic posting for tomorrow at 9 AM
- Integrates with calendar system

### Advanced Post with All Parameters

/twitter Excited to announce our new features! project:announcements schedule:Dec 25 2pm settings:everyone
```

**Result:**

- Schedules for December 25th at 2 PM
- Sets reply settings to everyone
- Full workflow automation

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure

When a Twitter post is created, the agent generates a `.x` file with the following content structure:

```json
{
  "fileName": "twitter-post-timestamp.x",
  "platform": "twitter",
  "content": {
    "text": "Your post content here...",
    "replySettings": "following",
    "scheduledDate": "",
    "scheduledTime": "",
    "isThread": false,
    "threadTweets": ["Your post content here..."],
    "hasPoll": false,
    "pollOptions": ["", ""],
    "pollDuration": 1440
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "status": "draft"
}
```

### Project Selection Logic

1. **Explicit Project**: If user specifies `project:name`, use exact match
2. **Intelligent Matching**: If project name partially matches existing folder
3. **Default Creation**: Creates "Social Media" folder if no projects exist
4. **Fallback**: Uses first available non-pinned project folder

### Scheduling Parser

The agent includes a sophisticated natural language date parser:

- **"tomorrow 2pm"** â†’ Tomorrow at 2:00 PM
- **"Dec 25 9am"** â†’ December 25th at 9:00 AM
- **"next week"** â†’ Default time next week
- **Relative dates** â†’ Calculated from current date/time

### Integration Points

- **Editor Store**: Creates files and manages project folders
- **Social Post Hook**: Integrates with existing `useSocialPost`
- **X API Hook**: Uses `useXApi` for actual posting
- **Calendar System**: Syncs with scheduling infrastructure
