  - `/status` - System health monitoring  
  - `/help` - Intelligent help routing

### 2. **Intelligent Routing System**
- Analyzes user intent automatically
- Routes to appropriate agents with confidence scoring
- Fallback to parent orchestrator for guidance
- Natural language command understanding

### 3. **Post-Onboarding Integration**
- Automatic detection when onboarding completes
- Personalized welcome message with next steps
- Seamless transition to productive usage
- Progressive feature disclosure

### 4. **Context & Metrics System**
- Cross-agent communication protocol
- Performance metrics collection
- Execution tracking and error monitoring
- User preference learning

### 5. **Workflow Automation**
- Pre-defined workflow templates
- Custom workflow generation
- Sequential agent execution
- Error handling and rollback

## üéØ How It Works

### User Journey Flow
1. **User completes onboarding** ‚Üí Orchestration system activates
2. **Post-onboarding guidance appears** ‚Üí Personalized welcome message
3. **User types natural language** ‚Üí Intelligent routing analyzes intent
4. **System routes to best agent** ‚Üí Direct execution or orchestrator guidance
5. **Results tracked & learned** ‚Üí System improves recommendations

### Command Examples
```bash
# After onboarding, these commands are now available:

# Get personalized guidance
/guide
/guide what should I do next?

# Create automated workflows  
/workflow create social content and schedule it
/workflow document my project completely

# Monitor system performance
/status

# Get intelligent help
/help twitter posting
/help how do I create campaigns?

# Natural language routing
"what should i do next?"
"help me create a twitter post"
"show me system status"
```

### Routing Intelligence
The system automatically detects user intent and routes to appropriate agents:

- **Social content** ‚Üí Twitter Agent
- **Project setup** ‚Üí Project Creator Agent  
- **Documentation** ‚Üí Instructions Agent
- **Scheduling** ‚Üí Scheduling Agent
- **General guidance** ‚Üí Parent Orchestrator

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Agent Registry
```typescript
// Automatically registered in order:
1. onboardingAgent
2. parentOrchestratorAgent ‚Üê NEW
3. instructionsAgent
4. schedulingAgent
5. projectCreatorAgent
// ... other agents
```

### Context Management
```typescript
// Cross-agent state tracking
useAgentContextStore() // Metrics, communication, workflows
useOrchestrationStore() // Post-onboarding, routing intelligence
useAgentStore() // Enhanced with orchestration methods
```

### Chat Integration
```typescript
// Intelligent routing in chat
if (messageContent.includes('/guide') || 
    messageContent.includes('what should i do')) {
  // Route to parent orchestrator
  executeAgentTool('parent-orchestrator', toolId, input);
}
```
